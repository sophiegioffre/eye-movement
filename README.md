# Eye Movement Exercise

## DESCRIPTION
This project is based on an exercise from MIT xPro Full-Stack Development course, and its foucus is on manipulating styles with JavaScript and CSS. When viewed in a browser, a webpage with depicting two "eyes" is displayed. The "eyes" follow the movement of the mouse. 

## HOW TO RUN
Clone all files in this repo to your local drive. Then open the index.html file in a browser, perferibly Google Chrome. Move your mouse to make the "eyes" move. 

## ROAD MAP TO FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
•	Add a button that, when clicked, generates new "eyes" randomly across the page that also respond to mouse movement.
<br>
•	Add a Cheshire Cat inspired grin to complete the visage. Change the background to look like the Cheshire Cat's magenta striped coat.
